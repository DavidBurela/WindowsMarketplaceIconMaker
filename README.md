Microsoft Build - Windows Phone 7 app=============A companion application for attendees of Microsoft Build 2012 conference.  It is based on the "Starter kit for conferences"  [http://smallandmighty.net/blog/windows-phone-starter-kit-for-conferences](http://smallandmighty.net/blog/windows-phone-starter-kit-for-conferences)The application was simplified greatly by replacing the custom logic for grouping and sorting, and instead replacing it with the [NetAdvantage controls for Windows Phone](http://www.infragistics.com/products/windows-phone) which support this functionality directly. This also sped up the loading and scrolling of the list dramatically.I also added functionality to cache the OData results for 2 hours.Features--------* Search through session code, title &amp; abstract to find exactly what you are looking for!* Sessions by timeslot, easily discover which sessions are on right now* Links to slides* Links to video streams* Save sessions to favourites* Sessions cached for 2 hours to reduce network bandwidthDownloading--------The application is available for free on the Windows Phone 7 marketplace. How I built it--------I have written a post-mortem on how the application was built, how I modified the original framework, and what I learned from the experience. You can read it here on my blog [http://davidburela.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/post-mortem-of-the-microsoft-teched-wp7-app/](http://davidburela.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/post-mortem-of-the-microsoft-teched-wp7-app/)Packages used--------* Windows Phone Starter Kit for Conferences - [http://smallandmighty.net/blog/windows-phone-starter-kit-for-conferences](http://smallandmighty.net/blog/windows-phone-starter-kit-for-conferences)* YLAD (Your Last About Dialog) - [http://ylad.codeplex.com/](http://ylad.codeplex.com/)* Windows Phone Icons Maker [http://wpiconmaker.codeplex.com/](http://wpiconmaker.codeplex.com/)Notes--------The [NetAdvantage controls for Windows Phone](http://www.infragistics.com/products/windows-phone) were used to build this application.
